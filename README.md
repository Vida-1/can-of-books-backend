# Can-of-Books
**Author**: Vida Powell, Martha Quintanilla-Ramirez, Natalija Germek
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This project is comprised of a React front-end connected to a back-end Express server which connects to a Mongo database seeded with data related to some of our favorite books. This app will track some of those books that have had an impact on us, and present a list to user of some books that have been recommended.

## Getting Started
In order to build this app on their own machine and get it running, user should:
* clone the github repo locally
* create a .env and seed it with a MongoDB connection link and password
* npm i dotenv
* npm i 
* npm start
* npm i mongoose
* node seed.js

## Architecture
This application uses HTML, React, JavaScript, and CSS. The build is run by Node.js, with an express server handling Axios distribution of data stored on a MongoDB serviced by mongoose.

# Can-of-Books
**Author**: Vida Powell, Martha Quintanilla-Ramirez, Natalija Germek
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This project is comprised of a React front-end connected to a back-end Express server which connects to a Mongo database seeded with data related to some of our favorite books. This app will track some of those books that have had an impact on us, and some that have been recommended to us for future reading.

## Getting Started
In order to build this app on their own machine and get it running, user should:
* clone the github repo locally
* npm i dotenv
* npm i 
* npm start
* npm i mongoose
* node seed.js


<!-- UPDATE: This would be things like npm i, npm start, changing any .env variables, etc.-->

## Architecture
This application uses HTML, React, JavaScript, and CSS. The build is run by Node.js, with an express server handling Axios distribution of data stored on a MongoDB serviced by mongoose. 

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully
implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location
resource. -->
